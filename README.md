# spring-petclinic-microservices-opentelemetrysample

Modifying the Spring Microservices Petclinic Application to use OpenTelemetry Agent auto instrumentation and either Signoz/Jaeger as tracing backend. Both Signoz and Jaeger are not included here and are meant to be downloaded separately and the configurations are straight forward, instructions below.


# Acknowledgements

This project is based on the original Spring Microservices Petclinic application, and we would like to thank its creators for their valuable contribution to the open source community.

# About this project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ease of use and effectiveness of OpenTelemetry agent v1.23 for instrumenting microservices monitoring. While most of the documentation remains the same as the original Microservices Petclinic project, we have added the OpenTelemetry java agent to showcase its capabilities.

For more info and latest version of the agent, please visit https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/

The original microservices version of Spring Petclinic was initially derived from [AngularJS version](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular1) to demonstrate how to split sample Spring application into [microservices](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html).
To achieve that goal, we use Spring Cloud Gateway, Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker, Spring Cloud Config, Micrometer Tracing, Resilience4j, Open Telemetry 
and the Eureka Service Discovery from the [Spring Cloud Netflix](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix) technology stack.

## Starting services locally without Docker

Every microservice is a Spring Boot application and can be started locally using IDE ([Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) plugin has to be set up) or `../mvnw spring-boot:run` command. For attaching the OpenTelemetry agent you can modify the command to `../mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-javaagent:../docker/opentelemetry-javaaagent.jar -Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://localhost:4317 -Dotel.resource.attributes=service.name=servicename-petclinic"`

Replace the `servicename` above with the respective microservice name when starting the application.
The above assumes the tracing server is also run locally. Replace localhost with the IP address of machine where tracing server is running for non-local scenarios.
Both Signoz and Jaeger listen for OTLP data in the 4317 port.

You can refer to the respective documentations of Jaeger and Signoz. The simplest way to get started is running them as containers.

## Incase you wish to use Signoz
Steps to install Signoz can be found here. https://signoz.io/docs/install/docker/

Post install Signoz Clickhouse UI will be accessible at http://localhost:3301

![Signoz UI](docs/signozui.png)

*NOTE: Signoz comes with a sample Hotrod application and Locust load script, so that even on first visit to the Signoz UI you will see list of services and traces, this is good for getting acquainted. However you can remove the sample application.*

## Incase you wish to use Jaeger
Steps to install Jaeger can be found here. https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.42/getting-started/

Post install Jaeger UI will be accessible at http://localhost:16686

## Supporting services to be started first before others

Please note that supporting services (Config and Discovery Server) must be started before any other application (Customers, Vets, Visits and API).
Startup of Tracing server, Admin server, Grafana and Prometheus is optional.
If everything goes well, you can access the following services at given location:
* Discovery Server - http://localhost:8761
* Config Server - http://localhost:8888
* AngularJS frontend (API Gateway) - http://localhost:8080
* Customers, Vets and Visits Services - random port, check Eureka Dashboard 
* Tracing Server (Jaeger or Signoz) - http://localhost:3301 for Signoz | http://localhost:16686 for Jaeger UI.
* Admin Server (Spring Boot Admin) - http://localhost:9090
* Grafana Dashboards - http://localhost:3000
* Prometheus - http://localhost:9091

You can tell Config Server to use your local Git repository by using `native` Spring profile and setting
`GIT_REPO` environment variable, for example:
`-Dspring.profiles.active=native -DGIT_REPO=/projects/spring-petclinic-microservices-config`

## Starting services locally with docker-compose
In order to start entire infrastructure using Docker, you have to build images by executing `./mvnw clean install -P buildDocker` 
from a project root. Once images are ready, you can start them with a single command
`docker-compose up`. 

The Dockerfile is updated to copy the OTEL agent jar inside each container during the buildDocker action. The agent jar attachment to the application is taken care of in the docker-compose.yml through specifying the java agent in entrypoint. Again the default port for sending the OTLP data to the tracing server is set as 4317. 

Containers startup order is coordinated with [`dockerize` script](https://github.com/jwilder/dockerize). 
After starting services, it takes a while for API Gateway to be in sync with service registry,
so don't be scared of initial Spring Cloud Gateway timeouts. You can track services availability using Eureka dashboard
available by default at http://localhost:8761.

The `master` branch uses an Eclipse Temurin with Java 17 as Docker base image.

*NOTE: Under MacOSX or Windows, make sure that the Docker VM has enough memory to run the microservices. The default settings
are usually not enough and make the `docker-compose up` painfully slow.*


## Starting services locally with docker-compose and Java
If you experience issues with running the system via docker-compose you can try running the `./scripts/run_all.sh` script that will start the infrastructure services via docker-compose and all the Java based applications via standard `nohup java -jar ...` command. The logs will be available under `${ROOT}/target/nameoftheapp.log`. 

Each of the java based applications is started with the `chaos-monkey` profile in order to interact with Spring Boot Chaos Monkey. You can check out the (README)[scripts/chaos/README.md] for more information about how to use the `./scripts/chaos/call_chaos.sh` helper script to enable assaults.

## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application

[See the presentation of the Spring Petclinic Framework version](http://fr.slideshare.net/AntoineRey/spring-framework-petclinic-sample-application)

[A blog post introducing the Spring Petclinic Microsevices](http://javaetmoi.com/2018/10/architecture-microservices-avec-spring-cloud/) (french language)

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:8080/

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (HSQLDB) which gets populated at startup with data.
A similar setup is provided for MySql in case a persistent database configuration is needed.
Dependency for Connector/J, the MySQL JDBC driver is already included in the `pom.xml` files.

### Start a MySql database

You may start a MySql database with docker:

```
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7.8
```
or download and install the MySQL database (e.g., MySQL Community Server 5.7 GA), which can be found here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

### Use the Spring 'mysql' profile

To use a MySQL database, you have to start 3 microservices (`visits-service`, `customers-service` and `vets-services`)
with the `mysql` Spring profile. Add the `--spring.profiles.active=mysql` as programm argument.

By default, at startup, database schema will be created and data will be populated.
You may also manually create the PetClinic database and data by executing the `"db/mysql/{schema,data}.sql"` scripts of each 3 microservices. 
In the `application.yml` of the [Configuration repository], set the `initialization-mode` to `never`.

If you are running the microservices with Docker, you have to add the `mysql` profile into the (Dockerfile)[docker/Dockerfile]:
```
ENV SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE docker,mysql
```
In the `mysql section` of the `application.yml` from the [Configuration repository], you have to change 
the host and port of your MySQL JDBC connection string. 

## Custom metrics monitoring

Grafana and Prometheus are included in the `docker-compose.yml` configuration, and the public facing applications
have been instrumented with [MicroMeter](https://micrometer.io) to collect JVM and custom business metrics.

A JMeter load testing script is available to stress the application and generate metrics: [petclinic_test_plan.jmx](spring-petclinic-api-gateway/src/test/jmeter/petclinic_test_plan.jmx)

![Grafana metrics dashboard](docs/grafana-custom-metrics-dashboard.png)

### Using Prometheus

* Prometheus can be accessed from your local machine at http://localhost:9091

### Using Grafana with Prometheus

* An anonymous access and a Prometheus datasource are setup.
* A `Spring Petclinic Metrics` Dashboard is available at the URL http://localhost:3000/d/69JXeR0iw/spring-petclinic-metrics.
You will find the JSON configuration file here: [docker/grafana/dashboards/grafana-petclinic-dashboard.json]().
* You may create your own dashboard or import the [Micrometer/SpringBoot dashboard](https://grafana.com/dashboards/4701) via the Import Dashboard menu item.
The id for this dashboard is `4701`.

Also checking feasibility to use Tempo for tracing as it integrates into Grafana.


### Custom metrics
Spring Boot registers a lot number of core metrics: JVM, CPU, Tomcat, Logback... 
The Spring Boot auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of requests handled by Spring MVC.
All those three REST controllers `OwnerResource`, `PetResource` and `VisitResource` have been instrumented by the `@Timed` Micrometer annotation at class level.

* `customers-service` application has the following custom metrics enabled:
  * @Timed: `petclinic.owner`
  * @Timed: `petclinic.pet`
* `visits-service` application has the following custom metrics enabled:
  * @Timed: `petclinic.visit`

## Interesting Spring Petclinic forks

The Spring Petclinic `main` branch in the main [spring-projects](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
GitHub org is the "canonical" implementation, currently based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.

This [spring-petclinic-microservices](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices/) project is one of the [several forks](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html) 
hosted in a special GitHub org: [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic).
If you have a special interest in a different technology stack
that could be used to implement the Pet Clinic then please join the community there.
